# Energy Balance Forecasting and Planning App

This project is an application for **calendar-based forecasting and planning of energy balance**, combining **machine learning** and **statistical methods**. The main goal is to predict energy consumption and production over time and help optimize energy planning.

## Project Purpose

The application aims to:

- Analyze historical energy consumption and production data.  
- Forecast energy demand using machine learning models (ARIMA, LSTM).  
- Assist in planning energy balance on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.  
- Provide actionable insights for energy management and optimization.

This project serves both as a practical tool and a demonstration of predictive analytics in the energy sector.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing for time series analysis.  
- Implementation of statistical models (ARIMA) and machine learning models (LSTM) for forecasting.  
- Visualization of predictions and actual energy balance.  
- Calendar-based interface for planning and reviewing forecasts.  
- Performance evaluation and model comparison.


## Tools and Libraries

- **Python** — main programming language.  
- **pandas, numpy** — data processing and manipulation.  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** — visualization.  
- **statsmodels** — ARIMA implementation.  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** — LSTM and other machine learning models.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — interactive data analysis and modeling environment.
